Agile Manifesto always emphasized individuals & interactions and we all know that when people are adaptive, then the organization is adaptive too. Humans are the biggest contributors in bringing Business Agility and in this remote working year and new normal, it is people and their innovative ideas that would drive organizations and their businesses to sustain and shine.
